But large number of workforce should be fulfilled from mass hiring which could cost more to Pewlett Hackard. We have found few alernative suggestion to Pewlett Hackard.

7. Out of 3% employees who already meet the mentorship eligibilty may not ready for new job because they tend to pursue same career path instead of changing career at middle way. 
8. Even if the employees who meet the mentorship eligibility can go for re-training or re-skill program, it would cost heavy to the company.

# Recommendation
1. The mentorship eligibility program could help Pewlett Hackard to fulfilled the work force supply chain but it is still not enough to match the total demand. So enterprise should have better plan to hire new employee.

2. Pewlett Hackard have another option to fulfill the total demand from the mentorhsip eligibilty criteria which might be very costly to Enterprise because retraining or re-skilling takes long process in enterprise level.

3. There is equal chances of having rejection from the employees to get train in to new skills because they resist to change or employees scare to change the career at middle way.

# Suggestions
Pewlett Hackard should have very better hiring stategy rather than reskilling the employee. More than 90,000 employees are ready for retirments means there might be Tsunami of getting retirement. So, enterprise should have immediate attention to hire new employees with different titles instead of reskilling or re-training.
